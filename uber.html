                  <strong>Overview:</strong> For this project, I worked
                  individually to design a new feature for the Uber Eats
                  existing mobile application in three weeks. I worked on the
                  research of the Uber Eats application and came up with two new
                  features that demonstrate the logic of the user interface,
                  then chose one of the proposed features and refined its idea
                  according to the received feedback from the teaching team.
                  Eventually, I created a complete mockup for the review feature
                  using ProtoPie and achieved my goal of helping users better
                  understand and expect dishes by adding more information to the
                  dishes based on user reviews, including ratings and pictures
                  of the dishes.

                <p><strong>Team:</strong> Yenan Huang (Individual project)</p>
                <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 weeks, January 2023</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>My Role:</strong> Researcher, Designer, Prototyper
                </p>
                <p><strong>Tool:</strong> ProtoPie</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <div class="d-flex flex-row flex-wrap align-items-center w-100">
            <div class="mx-auto p-5">
              <h1>Research</h1>
              <div class="text-left overview">
                <p>
                  At this stage, I analyzed the main purpose and target users of
                  Uber Eats and interviewed two target users for their thoughts
                  on the app to add to my knowledge of this application. <br />
                  <br />
                  To investigate further, I conducted a heuristic evaluation of
                  the Uber Eats app and found that the lack of pictures of
                  dishes made it difficult for users to match between the system
                  and the real world because customers see the appearance of the
                  dish rather than the ingredient list when they order in
                  reality. Uber Eats also does not give customers enough control
                  and freedom to control their orders. If any errors occur,
                  users cannot modify their orders further by contacting the
                  restaurant.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  To ensure that the new designs do not conflict with the
                  original design of Uber Eats, I analyzed the interface design,
                  interaction patterns, and user navigation framework
                  interactions of the application. This also helped users to use
                  the new features I designed without much burden.

                <p>
                  Based on feedback from the teaching team, I chose to design
                  the review section as a new feature for the Uber Eats app.
                  This new feature improves the flow of user browsing dishes and
                  complements the lack of information on dishes based on user
                  reviews, including comments, ratings, and pictures. In the
                  original process, users had to rely on other applications to
                  complete the information, whereas the new review session is
                  more in line with real-world conventions. <br />
                  <br />
                  I then created the interactive mockup using ProtoPie to add a
                  new review section to the dish detail page and improved the
                  Uber Eats app's original interface for users to post reviews.

                  Conducting research and designing a new logical feature for
                  Uber Eats as a three-week personal project in a semester with
                  four different course projects per week was demanding on my
                  time management skills. I am very happy that I have completed
                  it and achieved satisfactory results. <br />
                  <br />
                  This project focuses more on personal analysis and
                  investigation of the application, and the part of user testing
                  and feedback is missing due to time constraints. All I did was
                  interview two friends who were close to the target user to
                  understand the user's goals and concerns. Despite this, I
                  still accumulated valuable experience in the process of user
                  interface and interaction pattern analysis for the Uber Eats
                  application. If I have more time, I will invite the users
                  interviewed before to experience the current demo, and then
                  continue to improve it based on their feedback. I can also
                  introduce more human-computer interaction theories such as
                  mental models and cognitive load to analyze the problem space
                  from a higher level.
