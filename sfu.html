                  (HCI) course, I joined a group of three to evaluate and
                  redesign the SFU equipment booking website. During these five
                  weeks of work, I was mainly responsible for analyzing the
                  problems identified in the user research and proposing
                  solutions based on HCI theories. I then used Figma to help
                  build and modify the final high-fidelity interactive
                  prototype.

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <h6>
                  In the initial stage of the project, I interviewed two target
                  users and invited them to perform the usability test of the
                  site, which gave me more experience in interviewing users.
                  Combining data from other team members' research, I helped
                  streamline the user flow to help users quickly complete their
                  equipment borrowing needs. <br />
                  <br />
                  I then proposed solutions based on HCI theories for problem
                  spaces identified by teams together. The three solutions
                  correspond to the visual processing theory, information scent
                  & foraging, and the mental model of HCI. For example, in the
                  image below, the hyperlink to the booking portal on the left
                  side of the original design is hidden in the text, making it
                  inadequate for information scent, while the improved design on
                  the right side makes it more visible and provides a higher
                  information scent. This experience made me more proficient in
                  using HCI theory to analyze problems at a higher level and
                  generate solutions through brainstorming.

                <h1>Prototype Design</h1>
                <h6>
                  In the final presentation phase, I used Figma to help the team
                  build interactive prototypes together, and I also created
                  drop-down menus for dates, courses, and categories by using
                  variants. <br />
                  <br />
                  One of the major challenges I encountered was the creation of
                  the dropdown bar. I've only used HTML to create dropdown bars
                  before, but not Figma. I spent some time exploring on my own
                  how to create them more efficiently but to no avail. After
                  reviewing the documents, I discovered Figma's variant feature,
                  and with the guidance of the documents and team members, I
                  managed to create multiple dropdown bars using variants.

                <h6>
                  I enjoyed working with the other team members on this project
                  to evaluate and redesign the SFU equipment booking website. If
                  I had more time I could have helped the team design for better
                  accessibility in terms of visual impairment and colour
                  blindness, as well as creating a responsive UI accessible for
                  various mobile devices. <br />
                  <br />
                  I think what I have learned the most is to accomplish more
                  complete research and design within a limited time. This is
                  the first time I've done the initial prototyping by returning
                  to the same users and improving the design again with
                  feedback, in previous experiences I've only improved the
                  prototyping through the group's evaluation. This process has
                  greatly improved the prototype design because it is difficult
                  for us to examine our design from the perspective of users. I
                  will put more emphasis on this process in the next group UX
                  evaluation and design project, iteratively improving the
                  design with users.
