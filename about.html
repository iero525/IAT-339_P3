            My interest in new media design led me to the School of Interactive
            Arts and Technology (SIAT). I enjoy learning about design methods
            and theories that help make people's daily lives easier. During the
            three years of study, I have improved my ability to conduct
            effective user research, propose reasonable solutions, make
            intuitive prototypes, and implement designs through code. Besides, I
            also had opportunities to practice video production as my hobby in
            several projects to explore different ways of expression. I am
            passionate about pushing boundaries to provide solutions for clients
            as a UI / UX Designer.
